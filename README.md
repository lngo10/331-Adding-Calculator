# 331-Adding-Calculator

Description
Make a calculator that lets the user add, subtract, multiply and divide integers. It should allow exponents too. The user can only enter integers and must expect the result to be integers. The twist is that YOU, the programmer, can only let the program calculate expressions using addition. Only addition. The user can enter 3*2 however you cannot calculate it using multiplication.

Basically, the programmer is not allowed to multiply, divide and subtract using the operations provided by a programming language. To the programmer, the only accessible direct operation is addition.

Your calculator should be able to handle addition, subtraction, division, multiplication and exponents. No modulo operation (to obtain the remainder for two given operands) too.

Please note that

You are not allowed to use any functions (other than user-defined functions) to work with exponents. Basically, don't cheat by allowing pre-defined functions from a library for the dirty work.

You can use logical operators.

The only binary arithmetic operator that you can use is + (addition).

The only unary operator that you can use is ++ (increment operator).

No bitwise operations are allowed.
